Here is your Python code with added comments explaining each step:  

```python
import serial  # Library for serial communication
import time  # Library for time-related functions
import csv  # Library for CSV file handling

# Specify the serial port and baud rate for Arduino communication
SERIAL_PORT = 'COM10'  # Change based on your system (e.g., 'COM3', '/dev/ttyUSB0')
BAUD_RATE = 9600  # Baud rate must match the Arduino serial settings

# Open the serial connection to the Arduino
ser = serial.Serial(SERIAL_PORT, BAUD_RATE, timeout=1)  # Establish the serial connection
time.sleep(2)  # Allow time for the connection to establish properly

# Set up the CSV file for storing sensor data
csv_filename = "nimran.csv"  # Name of the CSV file to store data

# Open the CSV file in write mode
with open(csv_filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)  # Create a CSV writer object
    writer.writerow(["Timestamp", "SensorData"])  # Write the header row to the CSV file

    try:
        while True:  # Infinite loop to continuously read data
            if ser.in_waiting:  # Check if there is incoming data from the serial port
                # Read a line from the serial port, decode to string, and remove whitespace
                sensor_data = ser.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
                # Get the current timestamp in a readable format
                timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
                # Write the timestamp and sensor data to the CSV file
                writer.writerow([timestamp, sensor_data])
                # Print the timestamp and sensor data to the console
                print(f"{timestamp}, {sensor_data}")
                time.sleep(1)  # Wait for a second before the next reading for readability

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # If the user interrupts (Ctrl+C), close the serial connection gracefully
        print("Data collection stopped.")
        ser.close()  # Close the serial port connection
```
